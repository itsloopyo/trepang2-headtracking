:: Trepang2 Head Tracking - Install
:: ============================================
:: Thin wrapper - install body lives in cameraunlock-core/scripts/install-body-asi.cmd,
:: staged into the release ZIP's shared/ by Copy-SharedBundle. To change
:: install behaviour edit the body, not this wrapper.
::
:: Source of truth for everything below the CONFIG BLOCK:
:: cameraunlock-core/scripts/templates/install-wrapper-asi.cmd. Copy this
:: file to <mod>/scripts/install.cmd, fill in the CONFIG BLOCK, change nothing
:: else. scripts/conformance.ps1 checks that nothing else changed.
::
:: Ultimate ASI Loader: one DLL renamed to the proxy the game already
:: imports, with the mod shipped as an .asi beside the game exe. Check the
:: exe's import table before choosing ASI_LOADER_NAME - a proxy the game does
:: not import is never loaded and the mod silently does nothing.

:: Filename the ASI loader DLL is renamed to: the import the game exe already
:: has. Both CPPFPS-Win64-Shipping.exe (Steam) and CPPFPS-WinGDK-Shipping.exe
:: (Xbox / Game Pass) import WINMM.dll statically and do not import dinput8.dll.
set "ASI_LOADER_NAME=winmm.dll"
:: Subdirectory below the exe directory to deploy into, for engines that load
:: their proxy DLL from somewhere other than beside the exe. Source engine wants
:: bin\; a copy next to the exe is never loaded. Leave empty for everything
:: else, and set the same value in uninstall.cmd.
::
:: Empty here: games.json resolves the exe to CPPFPS\Binaries\Win64\ (Steam) or
:: CPPFPS\Binaries\WinGDK\ (Game Pass), so the body already deploys into that
:: folder rather than the install root.
set "ASI_SUBDIR="
:: Files copied only when they are not already there, so an upgrade keeps
:: whatever the user tuned. Listing an .ini in MOD_DLLS instead puts it through
:: the unconditional copy and resets every key on every update.
::
:: Empty: the mod writes HeadTracking.ini itself on first run, so there is
:: nothing in the ZIP to seed. uninstall.cmd removes it via MOD_LEFTOVERS.
set "MOD_SEED_FILES="
:: Version of the vendored Ultimate ASI Loader, recorded in the state file so
:: the launcher can tell which loader build it is looking at. Leave empty to
:: omit the field. Bump alongside vendor/ via `pixi run update-deps`.

:: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor, cmd.exe eats a `!` out of the
:: expanded line, and a real game path like C:\Games\Oh! My Game reaches the
:: body already mangled. The body pins expansion off at its own outer scope
:: too, but that is one `call` too late to save the argument it was handed.
